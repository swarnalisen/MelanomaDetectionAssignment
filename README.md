## General Information
This project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A model which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma is very helpful in reducing a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
